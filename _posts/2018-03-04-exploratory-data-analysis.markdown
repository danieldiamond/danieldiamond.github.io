[This project](https://github.com/danieldiamond/SAT-Scores) demonstrates one example of analzying a large incomplete dataset and using machine learning to predict SAT scores based on various features.

The general sequence will involve:
- Problem Definition
- Data acquisition
- Analysis of data
- Data Wrangling
- Modeling and Predicting
- Present Solution.

EDA is not rigid process and requires combinations of various stages. For example, we will perform a preliminary analysis of the data and concurrently correct or complete various features as necessary to ease the analysis procedure. Furthermore, we may wish to perform further anaylsis once we have a complete dataset after the data wrangling stage.
