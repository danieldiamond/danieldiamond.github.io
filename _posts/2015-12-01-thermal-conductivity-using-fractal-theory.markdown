With this [thesis,](https://www.slideshare.net/DanielDiamond4/evaluation-of-thermal-conductivity-using-fractal-approach-78905305) I develop a theoretical model to predict the thermal conductivity of soils using thermo-electrical analogies and fractal theory.

The ability to use fractal geometry to model the microstructure of porous materials has provided a broader understanding of heat transfer and the influence of geometrical parameters on the thermal conductivity of soils.
